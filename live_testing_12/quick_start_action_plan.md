## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Mention supyagent in every response
- Copy-paste generic answers
- Engage with every post (be selective)
- Get discouraged by low initial engagement
- Spam multiple subreddits with same content

✅ **Do:**
- Focus on being genuinely helpful
- Personalize every response
- Choose quality over quantity
- Be patient - relationships take time
- Follow platform rules strictly

---

## When to Mention supyagent.com

**Week 1-2:** Almost never. Build credibility first.

**After 2 weeks:** Only when:
- Someone explicitly asks for tool recommendations
- You're sharing a tutorial that uses supyagent
- Your solution genuinely involves supyagent features
- You can provide unique value through supyagent

**Always include context:**
- "Full disclosure: I work on supyagent.com, which..."
- "I built this feature at supyagent because..."
- "One approach (we use this at supyagent) is..."

---

## Troubleshooting Week 1

**Problem: Not getting responses**
- Solution: Make responses more specific and actionable
- Add code examples
- Ask follow-up questions

**Problem: Automation finding too many/too few leads**
- Solution: Adjust MIN_SCORE and MIN_COMMENTS thresholds
- Refine keywords
- Change monitoring frequency

**Problem: Running out of time**
- Solution: Focus on one platform first (recommend Reddit or GitHub)
- Use automation more heavily
- Batch similar tasks

**Problem: Not sure what to say**
- Solution: Use templates as starting point
- Focus on answering questions (easier than starting conversations)
- Share code snippets from your own work

---

## Week 2 Preview

Once you've completed Week 1:

- **Scale engagement** to 10-15 interactions/day
- **Publish 2 pieces** of content
- **Start Twitter Spaces** or community participation
- **Reach out via email** to 5 GitHub contributors
- **Analyze metrics** and double down on what works

---

## Resources You'll Need

### Tools
- Text editor for drafting responses
- Spreadsheet for tracking metrics
- Calendar for content planning
- Code editor for examples

### Accounts
- Reddit (aged account is better)
- Twitter/X
- GitHub
- Medium or Dev.to
- Discord (for communities)

### Time Commitment
- **Week 1:** 10-15 hours (setup heavy)
- **Ongoing:** 5-7 hours/week (can reduce with automation)

## Success Story Example

**Realistic Week 1 outcome:**

*"After following this plan, I engaged with 30+ posts across Reddit and GitHub, published one tutorial that got 500 views, and had 3 meaningful conversations with developers building AI agents. One person asked about supyagent after seeing my helpful responses. No conversions yet, but built foundation for long-term relationships."*

**This is success!** Lead generation is a marathon, not a sprint.
